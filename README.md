## Welcome to Hacking 0x101
 Have you ever wondered what does it feel like being a hacker ? How could one manage to successfully penetrate a website or how those "cool guys" on TV such as Eliot in the Mr.Robot series could infiltrate a system just like that ? Well you are in the right place. Head up that i am not saying that this post could train you into a complete bad*ss hacker. But it's a beginner guide to Hacking, or you can say "Penetration testing" or just "Pentesting" which was crafted from a few years of experiences of mine in Cyber Security.
